# Geospatial Data Scientist <span style="color:grey">| UCL Geography Graduate </span>

Welcome to my portfolio, where Iâ€™ll be sharing and discussing a few of my key projects. 

I'm driven by tackling complex, real world problems with a range of interdisciplinary skills honed throughout my Geography degree; passionate about blending analytical tools with a touch of design & creativity in order to make sense of the world.
