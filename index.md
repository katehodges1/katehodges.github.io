# Geospatial Data Scientist
As a Geographer, tackling complex, real world problems with a range of interdisciplinary skills has become second nature to me. I’m passionate about blending analytical tools with a touch of design & creativity in order to make sense of the world - harnessing **machine learning**, **geospatial analytics** & **storytelling** to transform messy, complex data into powerful insights!

Welcome to my portfolio, where I’ll be sharing and discussing some of my key Data Science projects. If you're interested, click on a project title to find out more, and visit my GitHub profile to see what I'm currently working on.
