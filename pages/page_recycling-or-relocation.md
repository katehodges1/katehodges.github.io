Recycling or Relocation?
*A 5 part Map Series*
This map series highlights the little-known reality of UK plastic waste: genuine recycling is far less common than it might be assumed. By tracing plastic waste from a national (UK) to global scale, it illuminates how our individual actions and choices are fundamentally connected to global environmental issues - despite it being easy to feel disconnected at time.

This was one of my favourite peices of coursework from my final year at UCL.
